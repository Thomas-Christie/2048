# 2048
This project was written whilst I was an Arkwright scholar. My mentor from Google DeepMind provided me with the stub of a TwentyFortyEight Python class that was written at DeepMind. I then implemented the methods to get a working version of the 2048 game, and then implemented an agent which used Monte Carlo Tree Search to play the game.
